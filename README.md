# CS348 Project

README.txt to describe how to create and load your sample database on your chosen platform.
You donâ€™t have to use the datasets described in the report. Toy datasets (e.g., a single table) can
be used.

## Local Development

Make sure you have Postgres 17 installed, then create a database called `cs348`:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE cs348;"
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following connection string:

```
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://postgres:@127.0.0.1:5432/cs348"
```

Run the initial migration

```bash
cd lib/sql
npm run sql -- --file=migrations/reddit_init.sql
````

Run the seed file to populate the database with sample data

```bash
cd lib/sql
npm run sql -- --file=scripts/seed_reddit.sql
```

Start the local development server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser. The log in page for Weddit will be displayed.

## Milestone 1 Features

You can view the `m1` folder for the SQl queries for each feature, where features 1, 2 and 4 have before and after logic to show the effect of the feature on the tables. These are in `.out` files.

To test a SQL feature, run the following command:

```bash
npm run sql -- --file=../../m1/feature1.sql
```

### Implementation of features

We have `api` endpoints for each core feature seen in the `app/api/reddit` folder. We implemented two of the four features from the milestone 1 list, the ability to create and delete a user. These can be found in `app/api/reddit/auth/register` and `app/api/reddit/auth/delete` respectively.

We also implemented the ability to select, create and delete a subreddit, which can be found in `app/api/reddit/subreddits/create`. This is the first feature that requires a user to be logged in.
