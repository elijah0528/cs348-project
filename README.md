README.txt to describe how to create and load your sample database on your chosen platform.
You donâ€™t have to use the datasets described in the report. Toy datasets (e.g., a single table) can
be used.

## Local Development

Make sure you have Postgres 17 installed, then create a database called `cs348`:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE cs348;"
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following connection string:

```
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://postgres:@127.0.0.1:5432/cs348"
```
