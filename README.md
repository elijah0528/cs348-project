README.txt to describe how to create and load your sample database on your chosen platform.
You donâ€™t have to use the datasets described in the report. Toy datasets (e.g., a single table) can
be used.

## Local Development

Make sure you have Postgres 17 installed, then create a database called `cs348`:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE cs348;"
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following connection string:

```
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://postgres:@127.0.0.1:5432/cs348"
```

Run the initial migration

```bash
cd lib/sql
npm run sql -- --file=migrations/init.sql
````

Run the seed file to populate the database with sample data

```bash
cd lib/sql
npm run sql -- --file=scripts/init-seed.sql
```

Start the local development server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open localhost:3000 in your browser. The sample data from the database will be displayed.
